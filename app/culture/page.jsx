          The people of Esan West are predominantly of the Esan tribe, and many
          are academic and non-academic staff of Ambrose Alli University, owners
          of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), subsistence farmers, and
          others engaged in civil service, trading, transportation, and students

          Esan West is home to the prestigious Ambrose Alli University (AAU),
          Ekpoma, which was founded in 1981 by Professor Ambrose Folorunsho
          Alli, a former governor of Bendel State (now Edo and Delta States).
          The university has since become a center for academic excellence,
          attracting students from across the country and beyond.

          Ekpoma's traditional leadership is headed by the Onojie, the king of
          the town, whose position is hereditary, passed down from father to
          son. The Onojie,s palace is situated in a community named Eguare. The
          village council, known as Iko-Edion, is led by the Odionwele, the
          eldest member of the community, who presides over matters involving
          the elders. The Edion (elders) are responsible for resolving disputes
          and administering justice in the community. Communication from the
          Onojie is conveyed through the Okhaimon to the Odionwele, who then
          convenes a meeting of elders to discuss and address community matters.
